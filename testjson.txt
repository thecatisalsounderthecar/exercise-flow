{"type": "calculation", "questions": "2.1 The dataset contains 1000 samples, including 500 positive examples and 500 negative examples. It is divided into a training set containing 70% of the samples and a test set containing 30% of the samples for hold-out evaluation. Estimate how many division methods there are.", "answer": "Permutation and combination problem.   \nThe division of training/test sets should preserve the data distribution as much as possible   \nThen the training set should include 350 positive examples and 350 negative examples, and the rest should be used as the test set. Then the number of division methods should be $ (x_{500}^{350})^{2} $."}
